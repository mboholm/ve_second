Previously we worked with *static word representations*, i.e. the representation does not depend on the context. To illustrate we can consider sentences (a) and (b), the word **bank** would have the same static representation in both sentences, which means that it becomes difficult for us to predict its sense. What we want is to create representations that depend on the context, i.e. *contextualized embeddings*. \n",

    "\n",
    "To train a neural network, we first need to prepare the data. This involves converting words (and labels) to a number, and organizing the data into batches. We also want the ability to shuffle the examples such that they appear in a random order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do all of this we will use the torchtext library (https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). In addition to converting our data into numerical form and creating batches, it will generate a word and label vocabulary, and data iterators than can sort and shuffle the examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a dataloader for the training and test set you created previously. So, how do we go about doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) First we create a ``Field`` for each of our columns. A field is a function which tokenize the input, keep a dictionary of word-to-numbers, and fix paddings. So, we need four fields, one for the word-sense, one for the position, one for the lemma and one for the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) After we have our fields, we need to process the data. For this we use the ``TabularDataset`` class. We pass the name and path of the training and test files we created previously, then we assign which field to use in each column. The result is that each column will be processed by the field indicated. So, the context column will be tokenized and processed by the context field and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) After we have processed the dataset we need to build the vocabulary, for this we call the function ``build_vocab()`` on the different ``Fields`` with the output from ``TabularDataset`` as input. This looks at our dataset and creates the necessary vocabularies (word-to-number mappings). \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Finally, the last step. In the last step we load the data objects given by the ``TabularDataset`` and pass it to the ``BucketIterator`` class. This class will organize our examples into batches and shuffle them around (such that for each epoch the model observe the examples in a different order). When we are done with this we can let our function return the data iterators and vocabularies, then we are ready to train and test our model!\n",

    "*   Overall accuracy is 48.4 which is not strong, but far from worthless, given the complexity of the task at hand. Kågebäck & Salomonsson reported substantially higher scores (66.9 for SE2 and 73.4 for SE3), but still leaving room for improvement. \n",
    "*   The neural model is better than the baseline for every lemma except one (*see*). We might specualte that *see* causes special for the model given its subtile (metaphoric) variation of meaning. Senses of *see* might be hard to clearly to distingusih for humans as well.   \n",
    "*   Predictions does not get better, with fewer senses of lemmas, or worse with many senses of lemmas. Pearson's correlation coefficient is close to 0 between Accuracy and No. of senses. (Of course, there would be a lower limit for this dissociation as No. of senses = 1, would yield 100% accuracy). \n",
    "*   There is however a strong correlation between Accuracy and Basline. This suggests that the model is better at predicting *dominant* senses. As the basline is determined by the most common sense of a word, words with high baselines are words where a large proportions of its tokens encode the \"baseline sense\". The model is especially good at predciting such common senses, seemingly independent of the number of other senses there are for the word.  \n",
    "*   There are some interesting exceptions to the previous point. For *force*, the model makes quite good predicitons, although this is a lemma without a clear dominant sense.Similarily, the model disambiguates *security* quite well despite its lack of a dominant sense. We might hypothize that these words have fairly distinct sense, appearing in quite different contexts, making them easier for the model to distingusih and recognize. "

The LSTM model represents tokens relative a sequence, so that representations of previously processed elements are \"remembered\" at the current state. BERT represents something different. It represents words and sentences at several levels (based on attention). When finetuned, the general \"knowledge\" of BERT is calibrated on a particular task; here: WSD. "
